# Redlog

Redlog is a fast and easy-to-use CLI for the Redmine project management tool.

Teams spend hours every week struggling to navigate around Redmine's clunky UI. With redlog, creating issues, logging time spent, and managing your team members can be as easy as executing a single command from your terminal.

Put new Ruby code in `lib/`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redlog'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redlog

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
